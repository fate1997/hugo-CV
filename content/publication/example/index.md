abstract: The use of machine learning in physicochemical properties modeling has
  great potential to accelerate the discovery and application of emerging
  solvent materials. Viscosity information of solvent materials determines
  dimensions for a pipe system, specifications for pumps or heat exchangers, the
  operability of the mixing and separation process, and the application of the
  product. However, the lack of experimental data and accurate methods for
  predicting the viscosity of solvent materials, especially those with complex
  interactions, remains unresolved. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), an emerging
  class of green solvents, have a severe lack of viscosity data, resulting in
  their application still staying in the stage of random trial and error and
  difficult to be implemented on an industrial scale. In this work, we
  demonstrate the successful prediction of viscosity of DESs based on the
  transition state theory-inspired neural network (TSTiNet). The TSTiNet adopts
  multi-layer perceptron for equation parameters calculation and subsequent
  verification using the most comprehensive, while still limited DESs viscosity
  dataset. The TSTiNet model, compared with the plain neural network model, has
  better generalization ability and dramatically reduces the maximum relative
  deviation of prediction under the constraints of the thermodynamic
  formulation. The proposed model, which requires only the structural
  information of DESs, is the most accurate and reliable model available for
  DESs viscosity prediction with the average absolute relative deviation on the
  test set of 6.84% and R2 of 0.9805.
