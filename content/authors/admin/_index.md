I am a post-graduate at Zhejiang University, major in Chemical Engineering. My research interests include drug discovery, molecular respresentation learning and graph neural network. I dedicate to apply artificial intelligence to advance science, especially in combining theory equation and neural networks.

At present, I am interested in following three specific studies. First, combining Schr√∂dinger Equation and graph neural network for molecular representation learning. Second, constructing a graph neural network for graph2graph tasks. Last but not least, generating molecules that meet specific needs.
